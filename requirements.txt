Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, 

run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


This will install all the necessary packages for your data scraping project. If you need to specify versions for any packages, you can do so in the format `package==version`, like this:
requests==2.25.1
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
pandas==1.2.4
tabulate==0.8.9
plotly==4.14.3

This ensures that specific versions of the packages are installed, which can help maintain consistency across different environments.
